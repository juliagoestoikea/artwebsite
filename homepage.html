         <h2>About Me</h2>
         <p>My name is Julia, and I'm a student studying Physics and Archaeology at Columbia University. I'm originally from San Francisco. In my free time, I love making art, so I decided to share it here. I work with all sorts of mediums, but most of my art is centered around memory. I look to understand how we make our memories and preserve them. I like to use art to synthetically create the methods that we use to preserve and create memories. I also make art with bacteria for Danino Studios whose work can be found <a href="https://www.taldaninoart.com/">here</a>. I also tattoo, and all of that info can be found on my instagram. Hope you enjoy and please feel free to reach out!</p>
